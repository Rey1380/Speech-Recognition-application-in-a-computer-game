# Speech-Recognition application in dodger plane game
<br>For speech recgnition, the audio must first be processed properly. Because audio is an analog signal,
Then, using audio signal processing algorithms, important features are extracted from the sound.
After extracting the important features, using machine learning algorithms, these features are given to a neural network and with its help, speech related lables are recognized.
In this project we have reconized the user voice command(up, down, left and right) in dodger plane game and the plane in this game can move by user voive command.
